# RENAME ME

## Description
Update me.

## Package
MacOs has weird compression issues when making .zip files, so use the following command for creating .zip to upload to Google:

    zip -r .chrome_extensions_assets/rename_me.0.v.zip *

Be sure to update the version number for the output.

## Template Notes
Add (icons)[https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/icons] to the images folder and declare them in the manifest before submitting a package.
